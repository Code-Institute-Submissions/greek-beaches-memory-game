<h1 align="center">Greek Beaches Memory Game</h1>

For my milestone project 2, I have made a memory game with a greek theme.
With every card you click you will discover another beautiful beach in Greece. 
For this game I have chosen my favourite, less touristic and less known beaches around Greece.
This game will inspire you to discover more of Greece in a fun way!

  - As a Visitor, I want to

    1. Before starting the game, I want to see an explanation of the game.

### Strategy
The goal of this website is to make a fun but visually pleasing memory game to inspire them to discover more of Greece.

### Scope
Instead of using well known greek beaches, the cards shows less touristic and less known beaches to amaze the players with every click.

### Structure
When opening the website you will be welcomed by a Modal with an opaque overlay, which will give you game instructions and a button to start the game.
The game will have a navbar with 2 modern looking buttons in the middle. One to restart the game, if wanted, and the other one to play or pause the music.
The game container has 4x4 cards with a greek style but simple background. The cards will be as wide as possible to prevent pixellation.
Above the cards you will find the timer and the flip counter.
Once you win or you run out of time, there will be a modal. When the time's is up, it will give you the option to start again.
If you found all the pairs within 60 seconds, a modal will appear with the amount of flips, how many seconds it took you to find all the cards and a button to start the game again.

### Surface
I wanted to make a modern, symmetric, and visually pleasing looking game. I wanted to avoid it looking childish or mixed with too many colors.
#### Colour Scheme
 - I've ran a color scheme with a picture of a beach in Milos,Greece that I found on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/465137467771700654/) through on [imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to find more color options.
        ![Color Scheme](assets/img/color-scheme.png)
 - The main colours used are: dark blue/grey (#343d47),grey, white (#fafafa) and blue.
#### Typography
 - The font-family used is Montserrat. It looks clean and suits visually.
#### Imagery
 - Background of the card has a greek themed pattern, but looks sleak, modern and clean.
 - Pictures chosen for the beaches are meant to amaze the player.
 - The favicon represents the background of the cards but smaller. So when users see this in their browser their reminded of the style of the game.
